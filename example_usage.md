### Download the following files:

- FEA results file (3 hour time point, p.adjust<0.0001): [GO_BP_3h_0.0001_4GF_basic.csv](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/GO_BP_3h_0.0001_4GF_basic.csv)
- GoI file (3 hour time point): [mmc2_goi_3h.csv](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/mmc2_goi_3h.csv)
- Setup YAML file: [mmc2_3h_setup.yml](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/mmc2_3h_setup.yml)
  
---

### Next, make your GeneFEAST project directory (folder) and navigate there. For example, in Linux:

```bash
mkdir my_genefeast_project
cd my_genefeast_project
```

<br>

Now copy all downloaded files to this directory. For example, in Linux, use the following commands to copy the files from their original locations to your GeneFEAST project directory:</p>

```bash
cp /full/path/to/fea_file .
cp /full/path/to/goi_file .
cp /full/path/to/setup_yaml_file .

# The precondition for these cp commands is that they are called from inside your GeneFEAST project directory.
```

<br>

---
### Now, staying in your GeneFEAST project directory, run GeneFEAST in one of the following three ways:

Through its [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container:

```bash
# assuming that the input YAML and data files are located in ${PWD}.
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/data -w /data ghcr.io/avigailtaylor/genefeast gf mmc2_3h_setup.yml <OUTPUT_DIR>
```

Through the command line:

```bash
gf <full/path/to/mmc2_3h_setup.yml> <OUTPUT_DIR>
```

In Python:

```python
from genefeast import gf

gf.gf(<full/path/to/mmc2_3h_setup.yml>, <OUTPUT_DIR>)
```

<br>

> Make sure `<OUTPUT_DIR>` does not already exist.

### Viewing the GeneFEAST report

- Navigate to `<OUTPUT_DIR>`
- Use a web browser to open file `mmc2_3h_communities_summary.html`

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> Viewing the HTML report requires a web-browser with HTML5 and JavaScript 1.6 support.
>
> Keep all output generated by GeneFEAST in `<OUTPUT_DIR>`; the HTML report uses relative links to images, and will break if the relative directory structure is broken.
