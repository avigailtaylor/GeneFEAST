Multi-OMICs landscape of SARS-CoV-2-induced host responses in human lung epithelial cells. iScience. 2023 Jan 20;26(1):105895. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.105895. Epub 2022 Dec 28. PMID: 36590899; PMCID: PMC9794516.

### Download the following example input files:

- Example FEA results file: [GO_BP_3h_0.001_4GF.csv](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/GO_BP_3h_0.001_4GF.csv)
- Example Genes of interest file: [mmc2_goi_3h.csv](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/mmc2_goi_3h.csv)
- Example config file: [mmc2_3h_config.yml](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/mmc2_3h_config.yml)

---
### Download the following example meta-input file:

- Example meta-input file: [meta_3h.txt](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/meta_3h.txt)

> **IMPORTANT** Open this file and put in the full path to your copies of GO_BP_3h_0.001_4GF.csv and mmc2_goi_3h.csv.

---
### Now run GeneFEAST in one of the following three ways:

Through its [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container:
```
docker run --volume $HOME:$HOME --workdir $(pwd) ghcr.io/avigailtaylor/genefeast:latest gf <full/path/to/meta_3h.txt> <OUTPUT_DIR> <full/path/to/mmc2_3h_config.yml>
```

Through the command line:
```
    $ gf <full/path/to/meta_3h.txt> \
         <OUTPUT_DIR> \
         <full/path/to/mmc2_3h_config.yml>
```

In Python:

```python
from genefeast import gf

gf.gf(<full/path/to/meta_3h.txt>, <OUTPUT_DIR>, <full/path/to/mmc2_3h_config.yml>)
```
> In all three of these examples, `<OUTPUT_DIR>` can be whatever you want it to be, so long as it does not already exist.

---
### Comparing your output to the example output

Once you have run GeneFEAST, you can download [this example output](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/mmc2_3h_output.zip), unzip it, and compare the output to your output.

#### Viewing the GeneFEAST report
To view the GeneFEAST HTML report, navigate to the output directory (specified by you in the `<OUTPUT_DIR>` parameter, above) and use a web browser to open
file `mmc2_3h_communities_summary.html`.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Viewing the HTML output report requires a web-browser with HTML5 and JavaScript 1.6 support.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Please make sure to keep all the output generated by GeneFEAST in the output directory; the HTML report uses relative links to images, and will break if the relative directory structure is broken.
> The same applies to [this example output](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/mmc2_3h_output.zip) once you have unzipped it.
