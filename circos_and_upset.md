## Circos and upset plots for visualising gene-set overlap

![Circos and upset plots](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/circos_and_upset.png)

**Figure 1. Circos and upset plots for visualising gene-set overlap.** GeneFEAST produces circos plots (**A** and **C**) and upset plots (**B** and **D**) to provide complementary visualisations of gene-set overlap between terms in communities (**A** and **B**), and between terms in meta communities (**C** and **D**). Circos plots for meta communities have an additional blue bar chart track which shows how many terms annotate a gene in any given community; this can highlight, for example, the presence of genes that are annotated by many terms in several communities. The plots shown here were generated as part of a GeneFEAST report summarising a FEA conducted on publicly available data (Pinto, et al., 2023).
