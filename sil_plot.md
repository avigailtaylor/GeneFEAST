## Silhouette plot of communities

![Silhouette plot of communities](https://avigailtaylor.github.io/GeneFEAST/sil_plot.png)

**Figure 1. Silhouette plot of communities.** An example silhouette plot generated by GeneFEAST. This silhouette plot was generated when GeneFEAST 
was used to summarise a FEA conducted on publicly available data (Pinto, et al., 2023) and nine communities of terms were identified. The red dashed vertical 
line indicates the mean silhouette score obtained over all terms. Added to the bottom of the silhouette plot is a green bar on a grey background indicating the proportion of 
terms identified as being part of any community containing two or more terms. In this example, ~90% of terms are in a community, meaning that ~10% of terms are singleton and 
have not been included in a community of two or more terms.
