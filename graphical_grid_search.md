## Graphical grid search of community detection parameters

**Figure 1. Graphical grid search of community detection parameters.** An example graphical grid search of community detection parameters generated by GeneFEAST. 
This graphical grid search was generated when GeneFEAST was used to summarise an FEA conducted on publicly available data (Pinto, et al., 2023) and nine communities of terms were identified. 
The graphical grid search is comprised of subplots such that each subplot characterises the communities obtained for a given tuple of overlap measure, gene set overlap threshold and maximum 
community size; the title of each subplot indicates the tuple of values used (OM = overlap measure, GSO = gene set overlap, and MCS = maximum community size). Within each subplot, 
the x-axis indicates how many communities of terms were obtained with this pair of values, with one bar/ violin plot pair being plotted per community. The violin plots are plotted 
against the left-hand y-axis and show the distribution of silhouette scores obtained for terms in each community; the red dotted line then shows the mean silhouette score obtained over 
all terms, and the black dashed line indicates a silhouette score of 0.5 (for reference). Underneath these violin plots are bars, plotted against the right-hand y-axis, that show the 
cumulative percentage of terms included in communities. GeneFEAST produces separate graphical grid searches for each of the two overlap measures available (Overlap Coefficient (OC) and 
Jaccard Index (JI)). The graphical grid searches always include a subplot for the overlap measure, gene set overlap and maximum community size thresholds set by the user, and 
the corresponding subplot is highlighted with a yellow background.
