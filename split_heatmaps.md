## Split heatmaps

The split heatmap, a data visualisation developed by us, underpins GeneFEAST (See Figures A and B). Using this visualisation, we can simultaneously depict term-gene and FEA-gene relationships, 
as well as gene level quantitative data, for communities of terms and their contributing genes. Crucially, the format can show multiple FEA results simultaneously, if required. Ordering genes based on 
hierarchical clustering of their quantitative data highlights global gene data centric patterns contributing to enrichments (Figure A). Alternatively, ordering genes by their term annotation counts and term annotation patterns 
highlights gene sets contributing to multiple enrichments; within these gene sets, genes are again ordered based on quantitative data, thus highlighting gene set specific gene data centric patterns contributing to enrichments (Figure B).
