## Split heatmaps

The split heatmap, a data visualisation developed by us, underpins GeneFEAST (Figures 1A(i) and (ii)). Using this visualisation, we can simultaneously depict term-gene and experiment-gene relationships, 
as well as gene-level quantitative data, for communities of terms and their contributing genes. Crucially, the format can show multiple experiments side-by-side, if required. Ordering genes based on 
hierarchical clustering of their quantitative data highlights global gene-data-centric patterns contributing to enrichments. Alternatively, ordering genes by their term-annotation-counts and term-annotation-patterns 
highlights gene-sets contributing to multiple enrichments; within these gene-sets, genes are again ordered based on quantitative data, thus highlighting gene-set specific gene-data-centric patterns contributing to enrichments.
