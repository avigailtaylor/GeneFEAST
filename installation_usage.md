## Installation

We **strongly recommend** installing GeneFEAST in a **virtual environment** because the library has several requirements:

- python == 3.7
- matplotlib == 3.3.3
- numpy == 1.17.2
- pandas == 0.25.2
- upsetplot == 0.4.1
- goatools == 1.0.14
- scipy == 1.3.2
- networkx == 2.5
- lxml == 4.4.1
- beautifulsoup4 == 4.8.0
- pillow == 6.2.0
- PyYAML == 5.1.2


> Please follow the instructions at the top of **[this guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)** to create and activate a virtual environment. Please only follow the instructions to the end of section **Activating a virtual environment** and then **come back here**.


> **IMPORTANT**
> If you do not have Python 3.7 installed on your computer, you will need to install it first, ***before*** creating a virtual environment.
> 
> (As an example, to install Python 3.7 on Ubuntu you would follow **[these instructions](https://vegastack.com/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-20-04)**.)
>
> Once this is done, make sure to create the virtual environment using Python 3.7 explicitly (i.e. not just the default Python used by your computer).


Once you have created and activated your virtual environment, you can install the library using pip:

```$ pip install genefeast```
